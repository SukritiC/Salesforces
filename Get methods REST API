Before you run the examples in this unit, youâ€™ll need to authorize the endpoint URL of the callout, https://th-apex-http-callout.herokuapp.com, using the steps from the Authorize Endpoint Addresses section.

Open the Developer Console from the Setup gear (Setup gear icon).
In the Developer Console, select Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window.
Delete the existing code and insert the following snippet.


Http http = new Http();
HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest();
request.setEndpoint('https://th-apex-http-callout.herokuapp.com/animals');
request.setMethod('GET');
HttpResponse response = http.send(request);
// If the request is successful, parse the JSON response.
if (response.getStatusCode() == 200) {
    // Deserialize the JSON string into collections of primitive data types.
    Map<String, Object> results = (Map<String, Object>) JSON.deserializeUntyped(response.getBody());
    // Cast the values in the 'animals' key as a list
    List<Object> animals = (List<Object>) results.get('animals');
    System.debug('Received the following animals:');
    for (Object animal: animals) {
        System.debug(animal);
    }
}

Select Open Log, and then click Execute.
After the debug log opens, select Debug Only to view the output of the System.debug statements.
The names of the animals are displayed.
